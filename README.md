# my-conky-backup
My conky files. They work on my arch linux DELL XPS 13. 
They whill require some modification for any other system. 
Even on the same system with a slightly other configuration it will most likely requier modification. 
BUT it is a good point to start from if you want system, network, sound (moc(p)) and weather information in a need conky widget.
